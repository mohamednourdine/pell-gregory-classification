## What is a Guassian Filter?

A Gaussian filter is a linear filter. It's usually used to blur the image or to reduce noise. If you use two of them and subtract, you can use them for "unsharp masking" (edge detection). The Gaussian filter alone will blur edges and reduce contrast.

## What is Radial Error?

 The radial error is the distance between the desired point of impact and actual point of impact, both points projected and measured on an imaginary plane drawn perpendicular to the flight path of the munition.


 ## what is affine transformation in image processing?

 Affine transformation is a linear mapping method that preserves points, straight lines, and planes. Sets of parallel lines remain parallel after an affine transformation. The affine transformation technique is typically used to correct for geometric distortions or deformations that occur with non-ideal camera angles.
