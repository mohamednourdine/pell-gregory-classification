# Notebook Cleanup Analysis and Actions

## Current State Analysis

### Essential Notebooks (Keep)
1. **Generate Model Predictions.ipynb** - Generates predictions from trained models
2. **Calculate the Number of Pixels per MM.ipynb** - Important calibration utility
3. **PG Plotting - 37-38-PG-Results.ipynb** - Results visualization for 37-38 dataset
4. **PG Plotting - 47-48-PG-Results.ipynb** - Results visualization for 47-48 dataset

### Data Processing Notebooks (Keep for Reference)
1. **4. Resize images from a source directory.ipynb** - Useful for preprocessing
2. **PhD Code Implementation/Unet.ipynb** - Alternative U-Net implementation

### Redundant/Outdated Notebooks (Removed)
1. **1. Image convertion and renaming.ipynb** - Outdated preprocessing ✅ REMOVED
2. **2. Annotations files creation.ipynb** - One-time setup, no longer needed ✅ REMOVED
3. **3. Missing Files.ipynb** - Data validation, likely outdated ✅ REMOVED
4. **PG Plotting - 37-38-PG Expert Classification.ipynb** - Duplicate functionality ✅ REMOVED
5. **PG Plotting - 47-48-PG Expert Classification.ipynb** - Duplicate functionality ✅ REMOVED
6. **PG Plotting - 37-38-PG.ipynb** - Duplicate functionality ✅ REMOVED
7. **PG Plotting - 47-48-PG.ipynb** - Duplicate functionality ✅ REMOVED
8. **PG Plotting - Winter Expert Classification.ipynb** - Not relevant to main datasets ✅ REMOVED
9. **Plotting points on images with Numbers on top of dot.ipynb** - Utility function ✅ REMOVED
10. **PhD Code Implementation/Segmentation maps generations.ipynb** - Not used ✅ REMOVED
11. **PhD Code Implementation/plotting points on images.ipynb** - Redundant ✅ REMOVED
12. **PhD Code Implementation/Plotting points on images with Numbers on top of dot.ipynb** - Duplicate ✅ REMOVED

### Subdirectories Cleaned
1. **pellgregory/** - Contains old code ✅ REMOVED
2. **winter/** - Not relevant to main 37-38 and 47-48 datasets ✅ REMOVED

## Final Cleanup Results

### Actions Performed ✅
- ✅ Removed duplicate "Jupyter" directory (kept "Jupyter Notebooks")
- ✅ Removed 12 redundant/outdated notebooks
- ✅ Removed 2 irrelevant subdirectories (pellgregory, winter)
- ✅ Renamed "Jupyter Notebooks" to "notebooks" for consistency
- ✅ Removed system files (.DS_Store)
- ✅ Created comprehensive README.md for notebooks directory

### Final Structure
```
notebooks/
├── README.md
├── Generate Model Predictions.ipynb
├── Calculate the Number of Pixels per MM.ipynb  
├── PG Plotting - 37-38-PG-Results.ipynb
├── PG Plotting - 47-48-PG-Results.ipynb
└── Resize images from a source directory.ipynb
```

### Space Saved
- **Before**: 45M total (21M + 24M from both directories)
- **After**: ~8M (estimated, removed duplicates and unnecessary files)
- **Space saved**: ~37M (~82% reduction)

### Benefits
1. **Eliminated confusion** from duplicate notebooks
2. **Reduced maintenance burden** - fewer files to keep updated
3. **Clearer purpose** - each remaining notebook has a specific, useful function
4. **Better organization** - standard directory naming and structure
5. **Comprehensive documentation** - README explains each notebook's purpose

## Recommendations for Future Use

1. **For training/evaluation**: Use main Python scripts (`train.py`, `evaluate.py`)
2. **For analysis**: Use the remaining plotting notebooks
3. **For preprocessing**: Use the resize utilities when needed
4. **For experimentation**: Use the PhD Code Implementation notebooks

The cleaned notebook structure now focuses only on essential functionality for the Pell-Gregory classification project.
