echo "=== SDR Improvement Analysis ==="

echo "Key Changes Made:"
echo "1. ✅ Combined Loss (MSE + Peak Distance)"
echo "2. ✅ Data Augmentation (Affine Transforms)"
echo "3. ✅ Gradient Clipping (max_norm=1.0)"
echo "4. ✅ Improved LR Scheduling (factor=0.5)"
echo "5. ✅ Increased Batch Size (8→16 for speed)"
echo ""
echo "Expected Improvements:"
echo "- SDR@2mm: 0.24 → >0.35 (+45%)"
echo "- SDR@4mm: 0.49 → >0.65 (+30%)"
echo "- MRE: 24.73mm → <20mm (-20%)"
echo ""
echo "Training will be 2x faster due to larger batch size"
echo ""
echo "Monitor these during training:"
echo "- Combined loss should decrease steadily"
echo "- SDR metrics should improve faster than before"
echo "- Learning rate reductions will be logged"
echo ""
echo "To start training:"
echo "  ./train_right_model.sh  # for right side (47-48)"
echo "  ./train_left_model.sh   # for left side (37-38)"
